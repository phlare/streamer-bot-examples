# i break for bots

use this as a sub action in streamer bot actions you want to ignore bots.

save bots.txt file in your /data directory in your main streamer bot folder and edit as necessary

import code.txt inside of streamer bot and use the imported action as a subaction at the top of any streamer bot action you want to ignore bots, or use as a breaking point within an action where the subactions following will not execute for bots, but the ones above will.
