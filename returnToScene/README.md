# capture and return to scene

here are two actions:    `capture scene` and `return to previous scene`  that both do what it sounds like they do.

the value of %currentScene% is stored in a global named `previousScene` that can be used in your other sub-actions.

you can just call these using the "Run Action" Sub-Action at the top and bottom of whatever you want to do in the new scene.
